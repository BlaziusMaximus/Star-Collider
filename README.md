# Star Collider

## Final project for Data Structures I (Fall 2017) at NCSSM

Star Collider is a '80s style arcade game in which the player mans a space-fighter-jet and takes on a set of three alien enemies.
The player must defeat these enemies before the blood-pumping rock song finishes.
After defeating each enemy, the player is given a power-up.
The jet has a healthbar in the top-left, and the jet's turrets have a cooldown indicator in the top-right.
Controls: arrow keys to move, spacebar to fire the turret.

All assets are either made by me or open source and modified by me.
This game uses C++ and SDL2.
